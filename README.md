# PracticeUtils

A heavily inspired take on [SpeedUtils](https://github.com/realJomoko/SpeedUtils/), and NinjaCookie's [NinjaUtils](https://github.com/Ninja-Cookie/NinjaUtils/tree/master/NinjaUtils) with all the same features + extra, done from scratch in my own way with mild reference to it.
TriggerTools.cs is taken directly from [SpeedUtils](https://github.com/realJomoko/SpeedUtils/) (Not including some edits), all credit goes to that and its creator(s).

New things include:
- Ability to save velocity, current move style when saving position.
- Ability to save / set storage speed from billboards.
- Ability to save / set the amount of boost the player has.
- Being able to set specific position values for your saved location.
- Resetting the graffiti for an entire area.
- Freezing all cars in place. REQUIRES AREA RELOAD TO UNDO!
